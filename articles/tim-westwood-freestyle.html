        <h1>How Smokepurpp Ended His Career in 40 Minutes</h1>
        <p>Smokepurpp's infamous freestyle on the Tim Westwood show was the beginning of the end for his career. The
            freestyle was seen as a desperate attempt to stay relevant in the rap game and was widely criticized by
            fans and other artists alike. It was made up of Smokepurpp talking over a beat and attempting to rap,
            but it was heavily criticized because he was not able to keep up with the rhythm of the beat. He was
            seen as a "mumble rapper" or someone with "mental disabilities" as he was more focused on making up
            words than delivering any meaningful lyrics. It was even more disrespectful that all the beats played
            came from great songs by respected artists.</p>
        <p>This freestyle immediately sent shockwaves through the rap community. Almost overnight Smokepurpp became
            the laughingstock of the hip hop scene and rightfully so. This freestyle is so bad it is physically
            painful to listen to. Anyone with any knowledge of the English language could have delivered a better
            freestyle than this moron. Once the drugs wore off after the show Smokepurpp most likely realized what
            he
            just did to his career, but there was no going back at that point.</p>
        <p>Following the freestyle, Smokepurpp's career never recovered, and he eventually faded away from the rap
            game. The freestyle was seen as the beginning of the end for his career, as it showed that he was not
            taking his career seriously and was not willing to put in the effort required to be successful. Not to
            mention this was over 40 minutes long, and it never occurred to his management that maybe they should
            cut
            him off and leave.</p>
